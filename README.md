# TomUI

TomUI is a custom registry of components built on top of shadcn/ui. It is designed to be used with React projects, expanding the amazing components of shadcn/ui, while also adding a new flavor and features on top.

Getting started is easy. Just simply have a React project with shadcn/ui installed, and then you can install any of our components through shadcn/ui's CLI.
